# plotSEMM

Graphing nonlinear latent variable interactions in SEMM.

## Description

Contains functions `plotSEMM_setup`, `plotSEMM_contour`, and `plotSEMM_probability`, 
which generate the diagnostic plots proposed by Bauer (2005) to investigate
nonlinear latent variable interactions in SEMM using LISREL output.

To install the development version from Github use the following:

```r
library('devtools')
install_github('philchalmers/plotSEMM')
