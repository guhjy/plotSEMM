- Computation of CIs - is there an easy way to allow users to specify a latent predictor value (eta_1), and have the CI returned? CIs are not very useful as a band, and are most useful when they provide estimate precision for a substantively meaningful eta_1 value.

- Think about the best way to provide examples for users.
Optimally, we can place mplus files in a directory on the server.

- I know it's a bare bones webpage now. But, think about how to make it look affiliated to York, and also include references, and the appendix. Seems unnecessary at this point.

	COMMENT: We can always add references and other information into the plotSEMM_GUI() help file, would that suffice? YES
