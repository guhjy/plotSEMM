- I don't know whether it's worth allowing users to change point types, line types, colors, and weights. It'll be nice if they utility can be used to generate manuscript ready plots.

	COMMENT: 1-3 are pretty low level, and fall into the customization category. Might be better just to solve this by exporting the dataset so they can edit what they please.

- Computation of CIs - is there an easy way to allow users to specify a latent predictor value (eta_1), and have the CI returned? CIs are not very useful as a band, and are most useful when they provide estimate precision for a substantively meaningful eta_1 value.

- Think about the best way to provide examples for users.
Optimally, we can place mplus files in a directory on the server.

- SEM Figure. Can the lines touch each other?. Also include a subscript [k] (with the square brackets) for alpha_1, alpha_2, beta_21, psi_11 and psi_22. Additionally, include circles and arrows for the measurement errors (epsilons). There shouldn't just be 3 indicators for each latent variable, so find a way to modify that, please.

	COMMENT: It's pretty hard for me to play around with the plot since I really don't like base R plotting, but you are welcome to if you don't quite like how it looks. It's currently in util.R -> examplePlot(), which you can run in R without having to relaunch shiny every time. 

- I know it's a bare bones webpage now. But, think about how to make it look affiliated to York, and also include references, and the appendix. Seems unnecessary at this point.


	COMMENT: We can always add references and other information into the plotSEMM_GUI() help file, would that suffice? YES

- Legend should reflect what is plotted.

	COMMENT: They mostly do already. Are there specific instances where they really don't? I know it values that don't actually show up, but that shouldn't really be an issue

- Other options for legend of contour plot should be within the contour plot. Right now, the options besides the default does not make sense. Ditto for probability plot.

	COMMENT: I don't understand what you mean here. Could you clarrify?

- Option to "Show class specific distributions, regression lines, and mixing probabilities (for contour and probability plots)?" should be checked by default.

	COMMENT: It is already....

- "Plot the confidence intervals using the Bootstrap method?" should not be checked.
Delta method CIs and CEs should be plot by default (for computational efficiency).

	COMMENT: This would require a pretty large rewrite, and the original code always computes the bootstrapp estimates anyway (so did the original package version). I don't think performance is bad at all, it only should be flagged for computing the confidence envelopes, which it is.
